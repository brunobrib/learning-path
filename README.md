# learning-path
This repo is meant to be a path for Computer Engineering, Computer Science and Data Science learning. Here I will post the resources/classes/tutorials I find useful to learn about the topics mentioned before.

The project is based on the [Developer's roadmap](https://github.com/kamranahmedse/developer-roadmap) repository.
